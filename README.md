# TopCoderPractice
My journey of practicing with TopCoder and eventually to compete.
Every day I'm going to solve one practice problem starting from DIV2 to DIV1 and then start competing.

## Challenges


### Div2 250
	1. AB - https://arena.topcoder.com/#/u/practiceCode/16319/46378/13642/1/325040
	I ran the tests and everything is working, but when I submit, it tells me to try again.
	If you spotted an error, please let me know.
	** Update **: After seen the results, my code breaks when using large data, so I need to fix that. 
	
	2. ** AkariDaisukiDiv2 ** - https://arena.topcoder.com/#/u/practiceCode/15124/25486/11889/2/312848
	Solve it properly!
